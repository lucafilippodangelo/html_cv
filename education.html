				<h4 class="bold">IBM.com, Research Campus labs, Mulhuddart, Dublin </h4>
				
				Responsible to manage two teams of software engineers based in London and Dublin.
				<p class="condensedlines"></p>
				Teams I do collaborate with are cross functional, backend/frontend/testing, main languages are Java, react. 
				<p class="condensedlines"></p>
				Main focus is on implementing “event manager and topology” algorithms and business logic able to monitor health and performance of IT and network infrastructure, this software is part of the Watson AIOps component.
				<p class="condensedlines"></p>
				In summary it’s a fully distributed software based on microservices using kafka as bus, then elastic, Cassandra, postgres(and PostGIS extention) for data storage. Most of the test pipelines at any stage of integration are managed by using Jenkins. Node.js serve as server in a sub part of our microservices.
				<p class="condensedlines"></p>
				I’m responsible to quarterly GA the topology product, deployed on both onprem(docker) and redhat OCP. While getting releases out I’m actively involved on planning, refinements, strategy etc..
				<p class="condensedlines"></p>
				Big chunk of my time is spent with customers. Triaging, strategy on enhancements, integrations, POCs, hotfixes, follow up of them etc.. In more technical customer calls I’m backed up by architects.
				<p class="condensedlines"></p>
				I’m as well involved in technical discussions and decisions, with full understanding of technical stack, reviewer of “hot” code and performance reviews, but in this project active code development is not my main mission.

				<h4 class="bold">Ocuco.com, Unit 1-3, 1st Floor Nexus Building, Blanchardstown Corporate Park, Blanchardstown, Dublin </h4>
				
				
				I’m proud to have been technically responsible of the team just after 3 months I joined the company as senior engineer. 
				
				<ul class="dashed">
					<li>60% team coordination
						<ul>
							<li>Driving technical refinement and implementation acting as a contact point for the team while interacting with other tech leads, architects, UI teams, functional team and test sub team. 
								<ul>
									<li>active collaboration with PO and designers in order to “map” functional requirements in logical flows, identify functional and not functional dependencies. Pattern used BDD</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Supervision of T-shirt pre development feature team estimation, feasibility study and as part of this risk reporting to senior management. </li>
							<li>Inspect existing code with the scope to improve performance. Responsible to build a tech debt/improvements backlog and coordinate the team by priorities. Some of the tools used: sonarlint, sonarcloud, logrocket.</li>
							<li>Responsible for team members performance reviews(yearly) and goal setup(quarterly)
								<ul>
									<li>As part of the performance discussion an ad hoc training plan(focused on future implementations) is created for each team component.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>New team components recruitement in collaboration with HR and senior manager. Responsible for interview technical tests.</li>
						  </ul>
					</li>
					<li>40% BE software engineering, as I was doing but more focused on code reviews, guidance on best practices, performance, regression, team CI pipeline, blockers, bug triage coordination.</li>
				  </ul>


				  I would like to mention lot of work done on mentoring of more junior colleagues in my team, most of the time the result was over my direct manager expectations in terms of performance and short time to achieve a certain level of integration and productivity. In the last year and half my team can boast zero turnover, potentially due to triangle pollination approach for knowledge and pairing approaches between engineers at any level. I try to push on this direction, when team components are more or less on the same level/knowledge the team start to be cross functional, confident and consequently productive.
